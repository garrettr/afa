## Why?

Trying a different CMS for the Alliance for Appalachia.
I think they want more flexibility than Mezzanine seems able to provide.

Don't spend too long on this - this is a complete rewrite, and should only be undertaken if you can
get somewhere significant fast. 

## Installation notes

Using the feincms virtualenv for development.

Dependencies:

1. feincms
2. django-mptt
3. PIL
