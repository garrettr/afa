Added accents.py:
/Users/grobinso/Documents/code/virtualenv/python-envs/feincms/lib/python2.6/site-packages/feincms/module/page/extensions/accent.py

This is a FeinCMS Page Extension. I'm keeping it in the repo - there's a symlink from the above path to the file in this git repo.

## Symlinks

The following three things are kept in the git repo but should be made accessible elsewhere. I use symlinks.

1.  `news/`
    Put this on your Python path.
2.  `feedeater/`
    likewise
3.  `snippets/`
    likewise
4.  `accent.py`
    is a FeinCMS page extension. To install it, symlink it into `feincms/module/page/extensions/`.
    `ln -s path/to/afa/accent.py path/to/feincms/module/page/extensions`

For now and forever: to make symbolic links, the syntax is: `ln -s <target> <linkname>`

## Bugs/Todo

RotatingFileHandler - not writing logs anymore, but FileHandler did?
Try `git revert HEAD` (for reverting committed mistakes)
Yup, it's writing logs again. Weird. Work on getting RotatingFileHandler to work.

Error on trying to load OVEC Facebook into feedeater. Something to do with the image.
